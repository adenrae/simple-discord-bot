# simple-discord-bot (deprecated see: https://github.com/adenrae/calciferQuotes)
 simple discord bot created in python that moves users out of the auto AFK voice chat feature and back into the channel they were just in.

 .gitignore hides .env file
    .env file is needed to store bot tokens and guild names, without it the bot will not be able to connect to the Discord API
